# Namaste React Course



## 1. Inception

- **1.1. Plain HTML**  
  Basic webpage using plain HTML syntax.

- **1.2. HTML using JavaScript**  
  Creating and manipulating HTML elements using vanilla JavaScript (e.g., `document.createElement`).

- **1.3. React via CDN Link**  
  Using React and ReactDOM through CDN links to build components and render them to the DOM.

- **1.4. React createElement**
  Creating React elements using React.createElement(tag, attributes, children)

- **1.5.  React createRoot and .render**
  Rendering React elements to the DOM using ReactDOM.createRoot and .render



## 2. Igniting our App

- **2.1. npm**
  npm doesn't stand for node package manager. there is not abbrevaition for it but it manages packages.

- **2.2. package.json**
  package.json is configuration for npm.

- **2.3. webpack , parcel, vite**
  Webpack, Parcel, and Vite are all JavaScript build tools that automate the process of converting code into browser-compatible JavaScript, optimize it, and bundle it into files for deployment.

- **2.4. dependencies**
  dev dependencies(-D) - dependencies required only in development
  normal dependencies - required in dev and prod.

- **2.5. tilde ( ~ ) and caret ( ^ ) in package.json**
  Tilde allows only the patch version upgrades avoiding the minor updates while caret allows updates to patch as well as minor versions.

- **2.6. package-lock.json**
  The package-lock.json file provides a snapshot of all the dependencies and sub-dependencies with their exact versions. It locks the versions of dependencies for consistent project setup across different environments.

- **2.7. node_modules**
  The node_modules can be automatically generated by using package.json and package-lock.json with the npm install cmd

- **2.8. Parcel**
  - **2.8.1. Dev Build**: Creates fast, unoptimized builds ideal for development workflows.
  - **2.8.2. Local Development Server**: Built-in server (e.g., `http://localhost:1234`) to serve and auto-reload the app.
  - **2.8.3. HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: Reloads only the changed modules instantly without refreshing the entire page.
  - **2.8.4. Caching**: Uses persistent caching to skip unchanged files, resulting in significantly faster rebuilds.
  - **2.8.5. Image Optimization**: Automatically compresses and optimizes images during the build process.
  - **2.8.6. Minification**: Minimizes JavaScript, CSS, and HTML by removing comments, whitespace, and shortening variables.
  - **2.8.7. Bundling**: Merges assets (JS, CSS, etc.) into output bundles to reduce HTTP requests and improve load times.
  - **2.8.8. Compression**: Outputs pre-compressed files (`.gz`, `.br`) for use with modern web servers.
  - **2.8.9. Consistent Hashing**: Adds content-based hashes to filenames to enable long-term browser caching and cache busting.
  - **2.8.10. Code Splitting**: Splits large bundles into smaller chunks that load on demand (e.g., per route/component).
  - **2.8.11. Differential Bundling**: Creates separate builds for modern (ES6+) and legacy (ES5) browsers to ensure compatibility.
  - **2.8.12. Diagnostics**: Displays detailed error messages and warnings to assist during development and builds.
  - **2.8.13. Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly runtime or build errors as overlays directly in the browser.
  - **2.8.14. HTTPS Support**: Supports secure development environments via HTTPS with self-signed certificates.
  - **2.8.15. Tree Shaking**: Automatically removes unused code from the final build to reduce bundle size.



## 3. Laying the foundation

- **3.1. scripts in package.json**  
  Defines commands like start and build to run and bundle the project using Parcel.

- **3.2. JSX**  
  A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code in React components.
  Use CamelCase in JSX attributes.
  {} - We can use this to write js code in JSX.
  JSX escapes to avoid XSS.

- **3.3. Babel**  
  A JavaScript compiler that transpiles modern JS and JSX into browser-compatible code.

- **3.4 Functional component**
  A function that returns a JSX code.

- **3.5 Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)**
  It is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts(usually JS) into website and that scripts runs in someone else's browser.

## 4.  Talk is Cheap, Show Me the Code
- **4.1 Build Food Delivery App**
  1. First, do the planning. build the wireframe.
  2. What components can app have?

- **4.2 Props**
  Sending Props to a Component is similar to sending to Arguments to a Function.
  When we want to dynamically pass data to a Component we use props.

- **4.3 Config Drive UI**
  It refers to building UI components and layouts based on external configurations - often in the form of JSON or other structured data - rather than hardcoding them in the UI code.

- **4.4 key**
  1. The key prop is used to help React identify which items have changed, been added or removed when rendering lists of components.
  2. It's not recommended to use index as a key.


## 5. Let's Get Hooked
- **5.1 Folder Structure**
  It isn't mandatory to have a folder structure. But it's good to have it.

- **5.2 export**
  1. default export
  2. named export  and named import
