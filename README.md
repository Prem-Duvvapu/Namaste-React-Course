# Namaste React Course



## 1. Inception

- **1.1. Plain HTML**  
  Basic webpage using plain HTML syntax.

- **1.2. HTML using JavaScript**  
  Creating and manipulating HTML elements using vanilla JavaScript (e.g., `document.createElement`).

- **1.3. React via CDN Link**  
  Using React and ReactDOM through CDN links to build components and render them to the DOM.

- **1.4. React createElement**
  Creating React elements using React.createElement(tag, attributes, children)

- **1.5.  React createRoot and .render**
  Rendering React elements to the DOM using ReactDOM.createRoot and .render



## 2. Igniting our App

- **2.1. npm**
  npm doesn't stand for node package manager. there is not abbrevaition for it but it manages packages.

- **2.2. package.json**
  package.json is configuration for npm.

- **2.3. webpack , parcel, vite**
  Webpack, Parcel, and Vite are all JavaScript build tools that automate the process of converting code into browser-compatible JavaScript, optimize it, and bundle it into files for deployment.

- **2.4. dependencies**
  dev dependencies(-D) - dependencies required only in development
  normal dependencies - required in dev and prod.

- **2.5. tilde ( ~ ) and caret ( ^ ) in package.json**
  Tilde allows only the patch version upgrades avoiding the minor updates while caret allows updates to patch as well as minor versions.

- **2.6. package-lock.json**
  The package-lock.json file provides a snapshot of all the dependencies and sub-dependencies with their exact versions. It locks the versions of dependencies for consistent project setup across different environments.

- **2.7. node_modules**
  The node_modules can be automatically generated by using package.json and package-lock.json with the npm install cmd

- **2.8. Parcel**
  - **2.8.1. Dev Build**: Creates fast, unoptimized builds ideal for development workflows.
  - **2.8.2. Local Development Server**: Built-in server (e.g., `http://localhost:1234`) to serve and auto-reload the app.
  - **2.8.3. HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**: Reloads only the changed modules instantly without refreshing the entire page.
  - **2.8.4. Caching**: Uses persistent caching to skip unchanged files, resulting in significantly faster rebuilds.
  - **2.8.5. Image Optimization**: Automatically compresses and optimizes images during the build process.
  - **2.8.6. Minification**: Minimizes JavaScript, CSS, and HTML by removing comments, whitespace, and shortening variables.
  - **2.8.7. Bundling**: Merges assets (JS, CSS, etc.) into output bundles to reduce HTTP requests and improve load times.
  - **2.8.8. Compression**: Outputs pre-compressed files (`.gz`, `.br`) for use with modern web servers.
  - **2.8.9. Consistent Hashing**: Adds content-based hashes to filenames to enable long-term browser caching and cache busting.
  - **2.8.10. Code Splitting**: Splits large bundles into smaller chunks that load on demand (e.g., per route/component).
  - **2.8.11. Differential Bundling**: Creates separate builds for modern (ES6+) and legacy (ES5) browsers to ensure compatibility.
  - **2.8.12. Diagnostics**: Displays detailed error messages and warnings to assist during development and builds.
  - **2.8.13. Error Handling**: Shows user-friendly runtime or build errors as overlays directly in the browser.
  - **2.8.14. HTTPS Support**: Supports secure development environments via HTTPS with self-signed certificates.
  - **2.8.15. Tree Shaking**: Automatically removes unused code from the final build to reduce bundle size.



## 3. Laying the foundation

- **3.1. scripts in package.json**  
  Defines commands like start and build to run and bundle the project using Parcel.

- **3.2. JSX**  
  A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code in React components.
  Use CamelCase in JSX attributes.
  {} - We can use this to write js code in JSX.
  JSX escapes to avoid XSS.

- **3.3. Babel**  
  A JavaScript compiler that transpiles modern JS and JSX into browser-compatible code.

- **3.4 Functional component**
  A function that returns a JSX code.

- **3.5 Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)**
  It is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts(usually JS) into website and that scripts runs in someone else's browser.

## 4.  Talk is Cheap, Show Me the Code
- **4.1 Build Food Delivery App**
  1. First, do the planning. build the wireframe.
  2. What components can app have?

- **4.2 Props**
  Sending Props to a Component is similar to sending to Arguments to a Function.
  When we want to dynamically pass data to a Component we use props.

- **4.3 Config Drive UI**
  It refers to building UI components and layouts based on external configurations - often in the form of JSON or other structured data - rather than hardcoding them in the UI code.

- **4.4 key**
  1. The key prop is used to help React identify which items have changed, been added or removed when rendering lists of components.
  2. It's not recommended to use index as a key.


## 5. Let's Get Hooked
- **5.1 Folder Structure**
  It isn't mandatory to have a folder structure. But it's good to have it.

- **5.2 export**
  1. default export
  2. named export  and named import

- **5.3 React Hooks**
  1. useState() - Super powerful variables in react
  2. useEffect 
  3. Whenever a state variable changes, react re-renders the component.

- **5.4 Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber)**
  1. Virtual DOM
  2. diff algorithm
  3. [React Fiber Architecture](https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture)

## 6. Exploring the World
- **6.1 Monolith**
  1. single application containing all code

- **6.2 Microservices**
  1. single responsibility
  2. separation of concerns
  3. you can have different tech stack for different services

- **6.3 Rendering approaches**
  1. Page loads -> API call -> Render
  2. Page loads -> Render -> API -> Render
  In react, we'll always follow 2nd approach. This gives better UX.

- **6.4 useEffect**
  1. This is called after the component is rendered.
  2. If there is no dependency array, it will be called on every render.
  3. If there is an empty dependency array, it will be called on initial render(only once).
  4. If there is dependency in dependency array, everytime the dependency changes the useEffect will be called.
  5. Always be called after initial render.

- **6.5 Shimmer UI**
  For better User Experience(UX)

- **6.6 Conditional rendering**
  Rendering based on a condition

- **6.7 CORS policy**
  [CORS Proxy](https://corsproxy.io/)

## 7. Finding the Path
- **7.1 router**
  1. react-router-dom
  2. createBrowserRouter
  3. RouterProvider
  4. useRouteError (hook)
  5. Outlet
  6. Link

- **7.2 types of Routing in web apps**
  1. Client Side Routing(React is single-page application because of this.)
  2. Server Side Routing

- **7.3 dynamic routing**
  1. /:param
  2. useParams()
  3. created server.js in root directory

## 8. Let's Get Classy
 - **8.1 Class based component**
    1. render()
    2. construtor(props)
    3. NEVER UPDATE STATE VARIABLES DIRECTLY
    4. First constructor() is called, next render() is called
    5. componentDidMount() - this is called after the component is mounted i.e. after constructor() and render() execution completed. This is why API calls are made in componetDidMount()

  - **8.2  Mounting Lifecycle**
    Updating DOM is expensive so react tries to batch the commit phase
    1. Render phase
      1.1. constructor()
      1.2. render()
    2. Commit phase
      2.1. React updates DOM
      2.2. componentDidMount()

  - **8.3 Updating LifeCycle**
    1. Render phase
      1.1. render() [New props, setState(), forceUpdate()]
    2. Commit phase
      2.1 React updates DOM
      2.2 componentDidUpdate()

## 9. Optimizing our App
 - **9.1 Custom Hooks**
      1. create new file for each hook in utils.
      2. Always start the name with "use".
      3. Online/Offline custom Hook.

 - **9.2 Chunking**
      1. Also known as code splitting/Dynamic bundling/lazy loading/ondemand loading/dynamic import.
      2. lazy, Suspense

## 10. Jo Dikhta Hai, Vo Bikta Hai (Styling)
 - **10.1 Different ways**
      1. external css
      2. Sass
      3. Styled components
      4. Tailwind (framework)
      5. Bootstrap (framework)
      6. material ui
      7. chakra ui
      8. Ant design
      9. postcss
  
  - **10.2 Tailwind css**
      1. install tailwind css
      2. [Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/parcel)

## 11. Data is the New Oil
 - **11.1 Higher Order Component**
    A component that takes a component, enhance it(add something on top of it) and return the component.

 - **11.2 Layers**
    1. UI layer - jsx code
    2. Data layer - state, props, local variables
    3. Accordion
    4. Uncontrolled component - The component is controlling itself.
    5. Controlled component - The component is being controlled(like parent).
    6. [Lifting state up](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components)
    7. [Props drilling](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
    8. React Context - createContext, useContext, UserContext.Provider, UserContext.Consumer(in class based components)

## 12. Let's Build Our Store
  - Redux is not Mandatory
  - zustand
  - Redux offers easy debugging
  - Redux - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps
  - 2 libraries - React-Redux, Redux-toolkit
  - Redux store is one big object. 
  - We can create separate slices in the Redux store.
  - Write data to redux store - clicked button -> Dispatches an action -> calls a function(reducer) -> this reducer function internally updates the slice of the redux store.
  - Read data from redux store - through Selector. This is known as subscribing to the store.
  - install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux.
  - Build our store.
  - Connect our store to our app.
  - Slice (cartSlice)
  - dispath (action)
  - Selector
  - createSlice(), configureStore(), useSelector(), useDispatch()
  - Subscribe to only the required part of the store. If you subscribe to the whole store it will still work but result in bad performance.
  - immerjs
  - redux devtools chrome extension
  - RTK query
